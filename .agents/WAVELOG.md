# Wave log

The lead's running record of what's in flight — **read this + CLAUDE.md + .agents/ first each session** to
reload state. One row per dispatched agent task; update on dispatch / review / gather / deploy.

## Current state of `main` (keep this 1-liner fresh)
- **"Anpi Learning" @ https://anpi-learning.pages.dev**, HEAD `16eeab4`. Learn = Leaflet/Esri satellite map.
  **113 lessons.** Wave-1 LIVE: real **badge wall** (lib/badges.js, supersedes legacy ACHIEVEMENTS via a
  guarded Badges.renderInto hook in renderStats), game **auto-pause on blur** + **per-deck best** on picker,
  **/api/tts per-IP rate-limit**, and **hardened Supabase RLS/grants** (SQL was run in the project on
  2026-06-11). **TTS now uses the FREE Google Translate `translate_tts` proxy — no key needed** (the paid
  Google Cloud TTS key requirement was removed 2026-06-12; audio verified 200 on live). **Old duplicate
  `anpi` Pages project DELETED 2026-06-12 — `anpi-learning` is the sole URL.** Remaining USER TODO: add
  `https://anpi-learning.pages.dev` to Supabase Auth Site-URL/redirect allow-list (sign-in). TB 🚀 Deploy
  button still targets old `anpi` — must change to `--project-name=anpi-learning` before using it (or it
  will error now that `anpi` is gone).

## Lead deploy checklist (run before every deploy)
1. On `main`, tree clean after ⇊ Gather (or intended changes only).
2. Review the gathered diff: **/code-review** (and **/security-review** if functions/ or SQL changed).
3. Validate: `node --check app.js && node --check lib/badges.js` (+ any edited build/lib JS).
4. If lessons changed: units count + every unit has journey + JOURNEY_XY; if game/UI changed: **/verify** or
   **/run** a quick smoke test (incl. mobile layout).
5. `npx.cmd wrangler pages deploy . --project-name anpi-learning --commit-dirty=true`
6. Log the deployment URL + what shipped; refresh the "Current state" line above.
